# Governance

Sohei is a decentralized finance protocol that is going to become increasingly decentralized as it grows and matures. The goal is to have everything run by a decentralized autonomous community (DAO) consisting of those who own $HEI tokens and both on-chain and off-chain governance structures.

To bring forth and vote on proposals affecting key parameters such as economics, security, and protocol development, $HEI tokens will be required. These proposals are called Sohei Improvement Proposals (SIP) and will be voted on by $HEI token holders.

Some of the parameters that users could vote on include:

* Interest rate models
* The addition of assets that meet the risk requirements of the protocol
* Risk parameters for over-collateralization and liquidation
* Changes to reward and incentive programs
* Improvements to the protocol, such as changes to smart contracts and governance processes

Through governance and progressive decentralization, Sohei aims to create a transparent, decentralized, and community-driven protocol. The $HEI token holders will have a say in the decision-making process, ensuring that the protocol develops in a way that benefits the community.
