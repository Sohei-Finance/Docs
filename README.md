## The Sohei Protocol

The Sohei protocol is a groundbreaking decentralized protocol for borrowing and lending built on the Arbitrum network. Sadly, a lot of cryptocurrency assets, like tokens, LPs, vaults, and derivatives, can't be used as collateral. This limits the assets that can be used as collateral.

Our innovative approach offers two main products: the Supply and Borrow Markets.

You can deposit your crypto tokens as collateral and borrow against another asset, with the amount you may borrow depending on the type of asset used. In addition, you can easily keep track of your collateral and borrowed assets on your dashboard.

DeFi applications like Sohei.io offer unique benefits, as they are permissionless and trustless. You can interact with the platform using any supported wallet without the need for a trusted intermediary. This means that you remain in complete control of your crypto assets.

Join the Sohei community and be a part of unlocking the value of your crypto assets today.
