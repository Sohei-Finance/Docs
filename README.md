# What is Sohei.fi

## The Sohei.fi Protocol

Sohei is a Decentralized protocol for borrowing and lending built on Canto.&#x20;

Billions of dollars are locked in crypto assets that cannot be collateralized, including tokens, LPs, vaults, and derivatives. At Sohei.fi, our mission is to unlock the value of these assets by supporting them as collateral.

The two main products the Sohei Protocol offers are the Supply and Borrow Market, in which you deposit your crypto tokens to the supply market as collateral for borrowing. When you supply an asset to the platform, it will automatically be enabled for use as collateral for borrowing against another asset.

You can use deposited assets as collateral to borrow against. The amount you may borrow in relation to your collateral depends on the type of asset used. You can find your borrow limit in your dashboard.

DeFi applications are unique because they are permissionless and trustless, meaning that anyone with a supported wallet can interact with them without needing a trusted middleman. you remain 100% in control of your crypto.
