# What is Sohei.fi

## The Sohei.fi Protocol

Sohei is a decentralized protocol for borrowing and lending built on Arbitrium. Unfortunately, billions of dollars are locked in crypto assets that cannot be collateralized, including tokens, LPs, vaults, and derivatives. At Sohei.fi, our mission is to unlock the value of these assets by supporting them as collateral.

The Sohei Protocol offers two main products, the Supply, and Borrow Market. This allows you to deposit your crypto tokens as collateral for borrowing against another asset. The amount you may borrow in relation to your collateral depends on the type of asset used and can be found in your dashboard.

DeFi applications like Sohei are unique because they are permissionless and trustless. Anyone with a supported wallet can interact with the platform without needing a trusted intermediary. As a result, you remain 100% in control of your crypto.

Join the Sohei community and be a part of unlocking the value of your crypto assets today.
