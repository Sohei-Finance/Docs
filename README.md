# ðŸ¥· Overview

## The Sohei Protocol

On the Arbitrum network, the Sohei protocol is a new way to borrow and lend money without a central authority. Sadly, a lot of cryptocurrency assets, like tokens, LPs, vaults, and derivatives, can't be used as collateral. This limits the assets that can be used as collateral.

Our innovative approach offers two main products: the supply and borrowing markets.

You can put up your crypto tokens as collateral and borrow against another asset. The amount you can borrow depends on the type of asset you use as collateral. In addition, you can easily keep track of your collateral and borrowed assets on your dashboard.

DeFi applications like Sohei.io offer unique benefits as they are permissionless and trustless. You can use any supported wallet to interact with the platform, so you don't need a trusted third party. This means that you remain in complete control of your crypto assets.

Join the Sohei community and help unlock the value of your cryptocurrency assets right now.
