# What is Hei

HEI is the multi-utility token of the Sohei Protocol. The utility is twofold: HEI stakers earn a part of the revenue generated by the protocol, and both holders and stakers are entitled to vote on important governance decisions.

$HEI token holders own and control the Sohei protocol. Protocol incentives and rewards will also be paid out in $HEI. As the protocol evolves, holders of $HEI will enjoy additional advantages, such as improved LTVs, reduced borrowing costs, and better deposit rates.

$HEI can also be staked to earn an APY and protect lenders against loss. Holders who have staked tokens can additionally receive fees from liquidations and earn higher APYs for having to hold their tokens for longer durations.
