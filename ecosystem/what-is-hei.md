# What is Hei

HEI is the multi-utility token of the Sohei Protocol. The utility is twofold: HEI stakers earn a part of the revenue generated by the protocol, and both holders and stakers are entitled to vote on important governance decisions.

The Sohei protocol is owned and governed by $HEI token holders. Protocol rewards and incentives will be paid in $HEI. As the protocol develops, $HEI will impart additional benefits to holders, such as improved LTVs, lower borrowing costs, and higher deposit rates.

$HEI is a utility token that provides a leverage ratio on the protocol, governance rights, and community participation. It can also be staked to earn an APY and protect depositors against loss. In addition, staked token holders can receive fees from liquidations and earn higher APYs for longer lock-up periods.
