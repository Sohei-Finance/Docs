# What is Hei

HEI is the multi-utility token of the Sohei Protocol. The utility is twofold: HEI stakers earn a part of the revenue generated by the protocol, and both holders and stakers are entitled to vote on important governance decisions.

The Sohei protocol is owned and governed by $HEI token holders. Protocol rewards and incentives will be paid in $HEI. As the protocol develops, $HEI will impart additional benefits to holders, such as improved LTVs, lower borrowing costs, and higher deposit rates.

$HEI is inherently a utility token that allows users to increase their leverage ratio on the protocol, participate in governance, and join our community. In addition to having functionality, $HEI can be staked to generate an APY and secure the depositors against loss. Fees from liquidations will accrue to staked token holders, with higher APYs given to tokens locked for a longer term.
