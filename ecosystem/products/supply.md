# Supply

Follow these steps to add liquidity to an asset on the Sohei Protocol and start earning rewards:

### Step 1:

Sohei.io requires you to connect your wallet. Metamask is currently the only wallet that can be utilized.

Before Sohei.io identifies your wallet, you must sign a message in it. There are no expenses or transaction fees associated with this procedure.

### **Step 2:**

On the market page, you can choose which asset you want to provide liquidity for.

Please keep in mind that the figures provided for each asset on the platform show the following:

1. Total Supply - This represents the current liquidity provided for the asset.
2. Total Borrowed - This shows the amount of assets currently borrowed by users.
3. Deposit APY - The Annual Percentage Yield earned on deposited assets. This shows the estimated percentage return on the assets you supply as liquidity.
4. Borrow APY - The Annual Percentage Yield paid on borrowed assets. This shows the estimated percentage cost of borrowing the asset.

### Step 3:

If the asset you want to provide liquidity for is not enabled in your wallet, you will need to turn it on. This lets the Sohei platform get to your wallet balance and use it. To use the asset, you will have to sign a transaction and pay a gas fee through your wallet.

### Step 4:&#x20;

To add liquidity on Sohei.io, enter the amount and click "Deposit." "Collateral" is always on, meaning the asset can be used as collateral for a secured loan. Your borrowing limit updates after deposit. Confirm transactions and pay gas fees through your wallet to complete.
