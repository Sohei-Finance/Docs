# Supply

To supply liquidity to an asset on Sohei.fi and begin earning rewards, you can follow the steps below:

### Step 1:

Connect your wallet to Sohei.fi, with Metamask being the currently supported wallet.\
\
When connecting your wallet to Sohei.fi, you will need to sign a message in your wallet. This process is free and does not require any transaction fees.

### **Step 2:**

Choose the specific asset you wish to supply liquidity for on the Sohei.fi platform.

Please note that the figures provided for each asset on the platform indicate the following information:

1. Total Supply - This represents the current liquidity provided for the asset.
2. Total Borrowed - This shows the amount of assets currently borrowed by users.
3. Deposit APY - The Annual Percentage Yield earned on deposited assets. This shows the estimated percentage return on the assets you supply as liquidity.
4. Borrow APY - The Annual Percentage Yield paid on borrowed assets. This shows the estimated percentage cost of borrowing the asset.

### Step 3:

If the asset you want to supply liquidity for is not enabled in your wallet, you will need to enable it. This allows the Sohei platform to access and use your wallet balance. You will need to sign a transaction and pay a gas fee through your wallet to use the asset.

### Step 4:&#x20;

To provide liquidity for an asset on Sohei.fi, simply enter the amount you wish to deposit in the pop-up window and click on the "Deposit" button.

Please note that the "Collateral" option is always enabled, which means that when you deposit an asset, it can be used as collateral for borrowing against another asset.

After you deposit the asset, your borrowing limit will change to reflect the new amount you can borrow.

To complete the deposit, you will need to confirm transactions and pay gas fees through your wallet.
