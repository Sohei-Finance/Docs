# Liquidation Process

Liquidation occurs when the borrower's assets exceed the Borrow Limit, meaning the collateral is no longer fully covering the borrowed amount. This can happen due to market fluctuations, and monitoring these changes is important. \
\
In a liquidation event, the liquidators seize the collateral and use it to repay the borrower's debt, taking a fee in the process.
