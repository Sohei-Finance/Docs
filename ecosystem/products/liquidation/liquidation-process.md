# Liquidation Process

Liquidation takes place when a borrower's total amount of borrowed assets is more than the "borrow limit." This means that the collateral assets are not enough to cover the full amount of the loan, according to the collateral factors. This can happen if the value of an asset that was borrowed or given changes, so users should keep an eye on the market and be ready for any changes.\

As part of a liquidation event, the liquidators will seize any liquid assets from accounts that have reached the liquidation limits and use those assets to settle the borrower's debt through market transactions, while at the same time taking a fee.\
