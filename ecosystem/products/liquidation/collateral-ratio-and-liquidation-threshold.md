# Collateral Ratio and Liquidation Threshold

The collateral ratio of an asset is how much of the asset can be used as collateral. The collateral ratios for stablecoins are high, like 85%, while the collateral ratios for BTC are lower, like 75%. You can borrow as much as the sum of the value of your asset and its collateral ratio.
