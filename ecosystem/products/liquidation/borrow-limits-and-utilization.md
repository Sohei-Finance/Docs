# Borrow Limits and Utilization

Based on the value of the provided collateral and the available liquidity, the borrowing limit specifies the maximum you are permitted to borrow. Borrow limit = 100% borrow utilization. When a user's borrowed position reaches the borrowing limit, which is when the amount borrowed is more than 100% of the total, the position will be liquidated.\
\
How much of the total value of the borrowed assets is covered by the total value of the collateral can be determined by looking at the borrow utilization. Users can basically use it as a visual indicator to determine how close or far they are to liquidation. The user's collateral is safer when the percentage of use is lower.\
\
A utilization rate between 75% to 90% calls for closer attention, while a rate above 95% is a high risk for liquidation. You can repay some of the borrowed capital or add more collateral to improve utilization.
