# Borrow Limits and Utilization

The maximum amount you can borrow is indicated by the Borrow Limit, which is based on the value of the deposited collateral and the available liquidity. \
\
The Borrow Utilization acts as a visual representation of the amount of collateral versus the borrowed assets. The lower the utilization percentage, the safer the collateral. \
\
A utilization rate between 75% to 90% calls for closer attention, while a rate above 95% is a high risk for liquidation. You can repay some of the borrowed capital or add more collateral to improve utilization.
