# Borrow

After depositing assets on Sohei, they can be used as collateral for borrowing. Your borrowing limit is displayed on the dashboard and depends on the asset's liquidity. If there's no available liquidity, you may have to wait for more users or repayments.

### Step 1:

To borrow an asset, click on the asset you want to borrow and make sure you have enough cash and haven't reached your borrowing limit.

### Step 2:

To borrow an asset, enter the desired amount and click "Borrow." You must ensure sufficient liquidity for the asset and that you have not exceeded your borrowing limit.

After this, you will need to sign a transaction and pay gas fees in your wallet to complete the process. You may also need to enable the asset in your wallet and pay a gas fee.

You can view your outstanding borrowed assets and remaining borrowing limit on your dashboard.
