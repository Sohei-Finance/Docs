# Borrow

Once you deposit assets on the Sohei protocol, they can be used as collateral for borrowing. The amount that can be borrowed against your collateral will vary depending on the type of asset used. You can find your borrowing limit displayed on your dashboard.

The availability of assets and the volume available to borrow depends on the liquidity of the supplied asset. If there is no liquidity available for borrowing, you may have to wait for a new user or the platform to supply more or for a loan to be repaid.

### Step 1:

To borrow an asset, click on the desired asset, ensuring adequate liquidity for the asset and that you have not exceeded your borrowing limit.

### Step 2:

To borrow an asset, enter the desired amount and click "Borrow." You must ensure sufficient liquidity for the asset and that you have not exceeded your borrowing limit.

After this, you will need to sign a transaction and pay gas fees in your wallet to complete the process. You may also need to enable the asset in your wallet and pay a gas fee.

You can view your outstanding borrowed assets and remaining borrowing limit on your dashboard.
