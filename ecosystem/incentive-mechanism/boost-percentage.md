# Boost Percentage

The Earn page also displays the "Boost Percentage," which shows the user's boost amount from multiplier points.

For example, if the APR for HEI is 10% and the user has $10,000 worth of HEI and esHEI, they would earn $1000 annually.

If they also have multiplier points equivalent to 20% of their total staked HEI and esHEI, the boost percentage would display as 20%, and they would earn an additional $200 in ETH rewards annually.

The boost percentage is calculated from the ratio of staked multiplier points to the total staked HEI and esHEI.

Let's say you have staked 2,500 HEI tokens and earned 2,000 multiplier points over the course of six months. Then, if you decide to unstake 1,000 HEI tokens, the proportional amount of Multiplier Points that will be burnt is:

1,000 / 2,500 \* 2,000 = 800 Multiplier Points

This means you will still keep 1,200 multiplier points, even after unstaking 1,000 HEI tokens. You can continue to compound and earn rewards with those remaining multiplier points or decide to unstake them later.
