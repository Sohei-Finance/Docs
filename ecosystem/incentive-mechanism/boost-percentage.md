# Boost Percentage

The Earn page also displays the "Boost Percentage," which shows the user's boost amount from multiplier points.

For example, if the APR for HEI is 10% and the user has $10,000 worth of HEI and esHEI, they would earn $1000 annually.

If they also have multiplier points equivalent to 20% of their total staked HEI and esHEI, the boost percentage would display as 20%, and they would earn an additional $200 in ETH rewards annually.

The boost percentage is worked out by dividing the number of multiplier points staked by the total number of HEI and esHEI staked.

Let's say that over the duration of six months, you have staked 2,500 HEI tokens and earned 2,000 multiplier points. Then, if you choose to unstake 1,000 HEI tokens, you will burn the following number of multiplier points:

1,000 / 2,500 \* 2,000 = 800 Multiplier Points

This means you will still keep 1,200 multiplier points, even after unstaking 1,000 HEI tokens.&#x20;

You can choose to unstake your leftover multiplier points at a later time, or you can let them continue to compound and earn rewards.
