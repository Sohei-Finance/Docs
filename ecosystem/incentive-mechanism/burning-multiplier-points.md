# Burning Multiplier Points

Once HEI or escrowed HEI tokens are unstaked, the same amount of multiplier points are burned. For instance, if 10000 HEI is staked and 5000 multiplier points have been earned since then, unstaking 3000 TND would burn 1500 (3000 / 10000 \* 5000) multiplier points. The burn will affect the total number of multiplier points, including those that have been staked and those that have not been staked.&#x20;
