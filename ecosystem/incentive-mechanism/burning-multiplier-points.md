# Burning Multiplier Points

If users unstake their HEI tokens, the proportional amount of Multiplier Points is burned. For instance, if 500 Multiplier Points have been earned from staking 1000 HEI tokens and the user unstakes 300 HEI tokens, 150 (300/1000\*500) multiplier points will be burned. The burn applies to both staked and unstaked multiplier points.
