# Why Arbitrum?

Sohei is built on Arbitrum because it is a blockchain platform that provides fast, secure, and low-cost transactions. It lets smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps) that can handle large amounts of data and transactions be made and run.

Arbitrum also has high scalability and privacy, which makes it a great platform for building decentralized finance (DeFi) apps like Sohei.

Arbitrum's flexible consensus mechanism lets developers choose the type of consensus that works best for their needs. All these features make Arbitrum an attractive platform for building DeFi applications, and Sohei is taking advantage of that to bring its unique set of financial services to its users.
