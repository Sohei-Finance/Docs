# Why Canto?

Sohei was built on Canto, an EVM-supported chain, because it promises to deliver a post-traditional financial movement that is accessible, transparent, decentralized, and free. \
\
Canto supports the Free Public Infrastructure (FIP) with a Tendermint consensus, an EVM execution layer, and financial primitives like a zero-fee DEX, a pooled lending market, and a stablecoin. \
\
Additionally, Canto's mission to become the best execution layer for original work, focusing on making liquidity a free public good, being rent extraction resistant, and minimizing user capture aligns with Sohei's values and goals.
